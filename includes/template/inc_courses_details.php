									In this example the Total Revenue is maximum when the elasticity of demand is unity, is this example specific or does it happen in any scenario? I mean, does the total revenue peak whenever the elasticity of demand is one and vice versa?

									Good question! Short answer: Yes! When the elasticity of demand equals 1, the Total Revenue is ALWAYS at a maximum.
									Long answer: If you're familiar with Differential Calculus, this fact is easy to prove because Total Revenue = Price x Quantity Demanded (which is the same as saying Price x Amount sold) and the maximum amount of Revenue occurs at the point where the derivative of Total Revenue with respect to Price is zero. Then, rearranging the terms gives us a definition of elasticity of demand.

									You are wrong about the change in TR being not equal to one at unity elasticity. 
									If you were allowed go from P3 to P3'=0.99*P3 AND go from Q3 to Q3'=1.01*Q3 
									Then the Elasticity would not be unity: 
									[0.01/1.005]/[0.01/0.995] ~ 0.99 
									Truth is, if your price drops by 1%=1/100, then your QD will go up by 1/99, in which case you will get elasticity one and TR the same as before.

								<div class="learn_right_question">
									In this example the Total Revenue is maximum when the elasticity of demand is unity. But how about the cost of revenue (salaries, etc.)? The firms real objective is to maximise profit, not revenue. But higher quantity at a lower price increases Total Revenue but will also increase Total expense. Surely that would be taken into account when setting up prices?

									This is called the Revenue Test.
									If price and total revenue move in the same directions, the curve is inelastic.
									If price and total revenue move in opposite directions, the curve is elastic.
									If total revenue barely changes or does not change, the curve is unit elastic.

									Use calculus for Pete's sake! (><) Please identify the audience already; do we know calculus or not? If yes, please spare us the 10 minutes here with one simple equation. Thanks a lot though :))
